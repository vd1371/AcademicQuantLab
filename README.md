# AcademicQuantLab
### A humble repository for academic quant strategies

I intend to collect the replicated codes that I have written, or write, based on the quant finance literature in this repository.The codes are written in JupyterNotebooks so you can see the results as well. Each notebook will be written in a way to be independently executable.

I will try my best to enhance the performance of each strategy, whenever I can.

#### Did you like it?
If you liked this repository and found it useful, kindly share it on LinkedIn and give it a star.

#### Subscribe:
You can subscribe to my periodicals [here](https://forms.gle/gtcpEwvYNFSy46nY9). I will send you an update once a new strategy is added to the repo.

#### Code Quality
The code is written in the simplest way so it can be understood easily and clearly. It is not production level code and not optimized for performance.
