    "# Trading Strategy Analysis Framework\n",
    "\n",
    "## Overview\n",
    "This project implements and analyzes four different trading strategies based on MACD (Moving Average Convergence Divergence) and VPVMA (Volume-Price-Volatility Moving Average) indicators. The strategies are tested on weekly market data with VIX integration for volatility awareness.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Strategies Implemented\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Traditional MACD\n",
    "- Uses standard MACD crossover signals\n",
    "- 12/26/9 period settings for EMA calculations\n",
    "- Weekly rebalancing with 1-week signal lag\n",
    "- 5% stop-loss protection\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. MACD Zero-Cross\n",
    "- Enhanced MACD strategy requiring:\n",
    "  - MACD line crosses above/below signal line\n",
    "  - MACD must be above zero for long positions\n",
    "  - MACD must be below zero for short positions\n",
    "- More conservative approach to reduce false signals\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. VPVMA (Volume-Price-Volatility Moving Average)\n",
    "- Novel approach combining:\n",
    "  - Volume-weighted typical price\n",
    "  - VIX-based volatility adjustment\n",
    "  - Similar signal generation to MACD\n",
    "- Aims to capture both price momentum and market sentiment\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. VPVMA Zero-Cross\n",
    "- Enhanced VPVMA strategy with zero-line confirmation\n",
    "- Requires both signal line crossover and zero-line validation\n",
    "- More selective entry/exit points\n",
    "\n",
    "## Technical Implementation\n",
    "\n",
    "The framework includes:\n",
    "- Parallel processing of multiple strategies\n",
    "- Automated data downloading using yfinance\n",
    "- Timezone-aware calculations\n",
    "- Comprehensive performance metrics\n",
    "- Stop-loss implementation using intraweek price data\n",
    "\n",
    "## Performance Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "For each strategy, the framework calculates:\n",
    "- Sharpe Ratio (annualized)\n",
    "- Portfolio returns\n",
    "- Strategy comparison metrics\n",
    "- Best performing strategy identification\n",
    "\n",
    "Results are automatically saved to:\n",
    "- CSV files for detailed analysis\n",
    "- Strategy comparison text files\n",
    "- Organized directory structure by symbol\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Risk Management\n",
    "\n",
    "All strategies incorporate:\n",
    "- 5% stop-loss protection\n",
    "- Position sizing based on portfolio value\n",
    "- One-week signal lag for realistic implementation\n",
    "- Intraweek price monitoring for stop-loss triggers\n",
    "\n",
    "## Data Requirements\n",
    "- Historical price data (OHLCV)\n",
    "- VIX data for volatility calculations\n",
    "- Minimum 5 years of data recommended for reliable backtesting\n",
    "\n",
    "## Future Improvements\n",
    "- [ ] Add position sizing optimization\n",
    "- [ ] Implement dynamic stop-loss based on volatility\n",
    "- [ ] Add more sophisticated portfolio management rules\n",
    "- [ ] Include transaction costs and slippage\n",
    "- [ ] Add cross-validation periods\n",
    "\n",
    "## Dependencies\n",
    "- pandas\n",
    "- numpy\n",
    "- yfinance\n",
    "- concurrent.futures (for parallel processing)\n",
